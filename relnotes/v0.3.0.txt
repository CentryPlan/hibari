v0.3.0 - Not Released (Early 2015)

This is a major release of Hibari.

This release requires Erlang/OTP R16 or 17. R16B03-1 and 17.3 are
the versions most recently tested for Hibari.

IMPORTANT: No upgrade path is provided from an earlier Hibari release:

- Storage Format Change:

    and Hibari v0.3.0 does not support older disk storage format.

    At this point, there is no plan to provide an offline migration
    tool unless someone asks for it. For more details about storage
    format change, please see GitHub issue at:
