v0.3.0 - Not Released (Mid March, 2013)

This is a major release for Hibari.

This release requires Erlang/OTP R13B04, R14 or R15. R15B03-1 is the
version most recently tested for Hibari. Note that this release is NOT
compatible with R16B.

Notes on upgrading from an earlier Hibari release:
- There is no change in disk storage format so the tables created by
  an earlier release should work without extra work.
- There are some client API changes. If you want to do rolling
  upgrade, you must update you application codes to deal with both
  v0.1.x and v0.3.x client APIs before upgrading Hibari cluster.
  For more details, please see GitHub issue gdss-client >> GH2
  <https://github.com/hibari/gdss-client/issues/2>.
  Future Hibari release may support different versions of clients,
  but v0.3.0 doesn't have such feature.


--- HIGHLIGHTS ----------------------------------------------------------

- New Client API - Server Side Rename
- Client API changes - Server Side Timestamp. brick_server will
  generate the timestamp for a key-value by default instead of
  client to provide the timestamp. In addition, return values from
  add, replace, and set operations contain the generated timestamp.
- Introduce Basho Lager for more traditional logging that plays nicely
  with UNIX logging tools like logrotate and syslog
- DTrace/SystemTap tracepoints to examine database latency in
  production
- Support for building and running on Joyent SmartOS (an illumos based
  Solaris variant armed with ZFS, DTrace, Zones, and KVM)
