v0.3.0 - Not Released (Early 2014)

This is a major release of Hibari.

This release requires Erlang/OTP R16. R16B03 is the version most
recently tested for Hibari.

IMPORTANT: No upgrade is provided from an earlier Hibari release:

- Storage format change:
  * The disk storage format is significantly changed in this release,
    and Hibari v0.3.x does not support older disk storage format.
    Therefore, it is not possible to upgrade from an earlier Hibari
    release.

    There is no plan to provide an offline migration tool unless
    someone asks for it. For more details, please see GitHub issue:
    gdss-brick >> GH17 <https://github.com/hibari/gdss-brick/issues/17>

- Client API change:
  * There are some client API changes. You must update you application
    codes for v0.3.x client APIs. For more details, please see GitHub
    issue:
    gdss-client >> GH2 <https://github.com/hibari/gdss-client/issues/2>.
